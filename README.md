# prompt-generator-comfyui
Custom AI prompt generator node for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI). With this node, you can use text generation model to generate prompts. Before using, text generation model has to trained with prompt dataset.

# Setup
## For Portable Version of the ComfyUI
- [x] Automatic installation is added for portable version.
- Clone the repository with ```git clone https://github.com/alpertunga-bile/prompt-generator-comfyui.git``` command under ```custom_nodes``` folder.
- Run the **run_nvidia_gpu.bat** file
- Open the ```hires.fixWithPromptGenerator.json``` or ```basicWorkflowWithPromptGenerator.json``` workflow
- Put your generator under ```models/prompt_generators``` folder. You can create your prompt generator with [this repository](https://github.com/alpertunga-bile/prompt-markdown-parser). You have to put generator as folder. Do not just put ```pytorch_model.bin``` file for example.
- Click ```Refresh``` button in ComfyUI

## For Manual Installation of the ComfyUI

## How Recursive Works?
- Let's say we give ```a, ``` as seed and recursive level is 1. I am going to use the same outputs for this example to understand the functionality more accurately.
- With self recursive, let's say generator's output is ```b```. So next seed is going to be ```b``` and generator's output is ```c```. Final output is ```a, c```. It can be used for generating random outputs.
- Without self recursive, let's say generator's output is ```b```. So next seed is going to be ```a, b``` and generator's output is ```c```. Final output is ```a, b, c```. It can be used for more accurate prompts.

## How Preprocess Mode Works?
- **exact_keyword** => ```(masterpiece), ((masterpiece))``` is not allowed. Checking the pure keyword without parantheses and weights. The algorithm is adding prompts from the beginning of the generated text so add important prompts to seed.
- **exact_prompt** => ```(masterpiece), ((masterpiece))``` is allowed but ```(masterpiece), (masterpiece)``` is not. Checking the exact match of the prompt.
- **none** => Everything is allowed even the repeated prompts.
### Example
```
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Original ---------------------------------------------------------------------- #
((masterpiece)), ((masterpiece:1.2)), (masterpiece), blahblah, blah, blah, ((blahblah)), (((((blah))))), ((same prompt)), same prompt, (masterpiece)
# ------------------------------------------------------------- Preprocess (Exact Keyword) ------------------------------------------------------------- #
((masterpiece)), blahblah, blah, ((same prompt))
# ------------------------------------------------------------- Preprocess (Exact Prompt) -------------------------------------------------------------- #
((masterpiece)), ((masterpiece:1.2)), (masterpiece), blahblah, blah, ((blahblah)), (((((blah))))), ((same prompt)), same prompt
```
